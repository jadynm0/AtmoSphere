# AtmoSphere
AtmoSphere is a pair of interconnected ambient spheres that sense environmental changes and translate them into shared light, allowing distant spaces to feel quietly synchronized. Rather than transmitting information, the system transmits presence, recreating the subtle comfort of being in the same room.
